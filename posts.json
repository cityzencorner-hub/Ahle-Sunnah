But when he got close, he turned back, terrified and pale, his hands dried on the stone until he dropped it. The men of Quraysh came to him and said: \"What's wrong with you, O Abu al-Hakam?\"\n\nHe said: I went up to him to do what I told you yesterday, but as I approached him, a male camel appeared in front of me. By God, I have never seen a head like his, nor a neck or tusks like his for any male camel. He was about to devour me.\n\nAbu Jahl's heroism was imaginary, and his boasting of threats was sophistical. It wasn't just once that he retreated, but many times, as narrated by the author of \"Al-Halabiya\" and Ibn Kathir in the biography, including:\n\nAl-Araashi, a man from the tribe of Khath'am, sold camels to Abu Jahl, who then delayed payment. The Quraysh directed him to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, knowing Abu Jahl's intense enmity towards the message and its bearer, peace and blessings be upon him. When Al-Araashi explained his situation to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, he went with him to ensure he received his due from Abu Jahl. When he knocked on Abu Jahl's door, Abu Jahl came out with a pale face, as if he were dust-colored, which is a yellowish hue with dullness. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said to him, \"Give this man his right.\" Abu Jahl replied, \"Yes, do not leave until I give him what is his.\" And he handed it over to him.\n\nAbu Jahl (LA) whenever he intended to hurt or insult Rasul Allah ﷺ Allah (SWT) always helped his Prophet ﷺ and made Abu Jahl afraid so much that he would start trembling. The one who used to make bold claims infront of the kuffar and the muhsriks would start sweating after seeing Rasul Allah ﷺ."},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https:\/\/alsunnahalislam.blogspot.com\/feeds\/1515775768209298424\/comments\/default","title":"Post Comments"},{"rel":"replies","type":"text/html","href":"https:\/\/www.blogger.com\/comment\/fullpage\/post\/249727478542539485\/1515775768209298424?isPopup=true","title":"0 Comments"},{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/249727478542539485\/posts\/default\/1515775768209298424"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/249727478542539485\/posts\/default\/1515775768209298424"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"https:\/\/alsunnahalislam.blogspot.com\/2024\/10\/abu-jahl-loser.html","title":"Abu Jahl the loser"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"anonymous "},"uri":{"$t":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/profile\/15261569427996281384"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$image":{"rel":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail","width":"16","height":"16","src":"https:\/\/img1.blogblog.com\/img\/b16-rounded.gif"}}],"thr$total":{"$t":"0"}},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-249727478542539485.post-3322879603227287424"},"published":{"$t":"2024-10-19T12:32:00.001-07:00"},"updated":{"$t":"2024-12-19T15:36:13.924-08:00"},"title":{"type":"text","$t":"“al-Mawāhib al-Ladinnīyyaħ”, ʾImām ʾIbrāhīm al-Bājūrī ash-Shāfiʿī does Tawassul through the rank of the Prophet ﷺ for his closing Duʿāʾ."},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"\u003Cdiv\u003E\"And this compilation, may God have mercy on him, was concluded by highlighting two significant points: an encouragement to perfect the science of Hadith, increasing in it, and exerting effort in acquiring it.

But the stone that broke the statue became a great, high mountain, and the whole earth was filled with it.\n\nThis is a prophecy of the emergence of Islam. Islam clashed at the beginning of the call with the Roman Empire and then with the Persian Empire. At that time, the Roman Empire had extended its authority over the Greek king of Alexandria and reached the peak of strength.

Then this kingdom was defeated and the Islamic conquest and the raids of the \u003Cb\u003EProphet ﷺ \u003C\/b\u003Eand the Companions brought it down .”\n\nAnd then we had the Ottoman Empire, which completely wiped out the Roman Empire and brought Islam to all possible places and became a great cause in spreading Islam in the Balkans.\n\nAnd as for the Christians claiming that they still rule those places now, that does not mean that they are correct, because there is no Christian rule there, but completely secular, and this prophecy was about a force that would cover all the lands, and it was fulfilled as the Muslims literally conquered all the places they had and ruled them and crushed them, just as it was written in the prophecy of \u003Cb\u003EDaniel AS\u003C\/b\u003E.\n\nAnd when Imam Mahdi will come, no land will remain in the rule of Christians or anyone else, he will end all the enemies of Islam and he will have his army which is famously known as the Black Flag Army and his army with him will conquer all the places and this time they will not allow anyone to remain as a polytheist, they will have no choice but to convert to Islam or fight and when they will fight, all of them will be ended and in some time\u003Cb\u003E Jesus AS\u003C\/b\u003E will come back and This time they will not allow anyone to remain a polytheist and they will have no choice but to convert to Islam or to fight and when they will fight all of them will be finished and in some time \u003Cb\u003EJesus AS\u003C\/b\u003E will come back again and all the Christians will convert to Islam and thus once again the Muslims will get back their great army and will rule over the whole world.\u003C\/div\u003E"},"link":[{"rel":"replies","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https:\/\/alsunnahalislam.blogspot.com\/feeds\/5115817677387807727\/comments\/default","title":"Post Comments"},{"rel":"replies","type":"text/html","href":"https:\/\/www.blogger.com\/comment\/fullpage\/post\/249727478542539485\/5115817677387807727?isPopup=true","title":"0 Comments"},{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/249727478542539485\/posts\/default\/5115817677387807727"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"https:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/249727478542539485\/posts\/default\/5115817677387807727"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"https:\/\/alsunnahalislam.blogspot.com\/2024\/10\/the-prophecy-of-prophet-daniel-as.html","title":"The Prophecy of Prophet Daniel (AS) explanation from the Bible of the ending of the 4 kingdoms and a Solid state replacing them"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"anonymous "},"uri":{"$t":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/profile\/15261569427996281384"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$image":{"rel":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail","width":"16","height":"16","src":"https:\/\/img1.blogblog.com\/img\/b16-rounded.gif"}}],"thr$total":{"$t":"0"}},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-249727478542539485.post-6005512150086982571"},"published":{"$t":"2024-10-17T14:28:00.000-07:00"},"updated":{"$t":"2024-10-17T14:29:02.130-07:00"},"title":{"type":"text","$t":"Imam An Nawawi (rh) on Muslim 2674 Hadith in the Sharh Sahih Muslim (vol:16\/228)"},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"\u003Cdiv\u003E\"This Hadith [2674] Whoever calls to guidance and whoever calls to misguidance, these two hadiths are clear in urging the desirability of establishing good things and the prohibition of establishing bad things, and that whoever establishes a good Sunnah will have a reward like that of everyone who acts upon it, until On the Day of Resurrection, whoever establishes a bad practice will bear the burden of everyone who acts upon it until the Day of Resurrection.
